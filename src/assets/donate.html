<p>Just to toot my own horn a bit for a moment... I've found out that a lot of people assume that
there's a group or some sort of organization behind Sky View Caf&eacute;. This web site, the Sky
View Caf&eacute; web app, and the legacy Java applet with which it all started, are actually all the
work of just one guy &mdash; me, Kerry Shetline. I've never thought about this web site as a profit
center (and I'd have turned out to be a terrible business person if I had!), but since I've poured
thousands of hours of effort into developing Sky View Caf&eacute;, I wouldn't mind seeing this labor
of love generate at least a little extra money to help defray the costs of hosting the web site on a
dedicated web server. I've decided to set up this donations page as my way of passing a virtual hat
around the room and seeing if the audience likes what they've found here enough to contribute to
that goal.</p>
